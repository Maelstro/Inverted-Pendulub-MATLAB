# Inverted-Pendulum-MATLAB
Implementation of control algorithms of inverted pendulum.

Implemented algorithms (working):
1. Parallel PID Control (both cart & pendulum)
2. LQR Controller (both cart & pendulum)
3. Robust Control (both cart & pendulum)
4. Fuzzy Logic Controller (pendulum only)

26.12.2018 - currently working on fuzzy logic controller.

26.12.2018, 20:55 - working FLC for rod angle position.

Made as a student project for Discrete Control, AGH UST.
